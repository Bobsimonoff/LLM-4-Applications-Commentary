# LM07: Insecure Plugin Design

## Summary
LLM plugins processing untrusted inputs and having insufficient access control risk severe exploits like remote code execution.

## Description

LLM plugins processing untrusted inputs without sufficient validation or access control can enable adversaries to achieve remote code execution, data theft, and other exploits.

Inadequate input sanitization and output encoding allow attackers to inject malicious payloads into plugins. Excessive plugin privileges combined with poor access control between plugins permit escalation and unauthorized actions. Successful attacks can lead to financial fraud, data breaches, reputational damage, and harm to end users.

Prevention requires strict input validation, output encoding, and robust access control in plugins. Inputs should be parameterized with type checking. Privileges must be minimized and interactions between plugins controlled. Extensive testing of plugins should occur, along with monitoring for anomalous behaviors. Following OWASP guidelines for secure development can mitigate plugin vulnerabilities. Reducing the attack surface through access restrictions and ongoing authorization validation is key.

## CWEs

[CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html): Improper Input Validation - Applicable when plugins fail to validate inputs properly. 

[CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html): Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation - Applicable if plugins do not neutralize untrusted web inputs, risking XSS.

[CWE-89](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html): SQL Injection - Applicable if plugins accept raw SQL inputs. 

[CWE-284](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html): Improper Access Control - Applicable when plugins have excessive privileges or inadequate access control.

[CWE-306](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/306.html): Missing Authentication for Critical Function - Applicable if plugins lack authentication.

[CWE-346](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/346.html): Origin Validation Error - Applicable if plugin request origins are not validated. 

[CWE-732](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/732.html): Inadequate Encoding of Output Data - Applicable if plugin output lacks encoding.

[CWE-807](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/807.html): Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision - Applicable if plugins rely on unvalidated inputs.

[CWE-862](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/862.html): Missing Authorization - Applicable if authorization checks are missing.
