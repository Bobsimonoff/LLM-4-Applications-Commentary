## Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) 

- [CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html): Improper Input Validation - Applicable when plugins fail to validate untrusted inputs properly, enabling injection attacks.

- [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html): Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation - Applicable if plugins do not encode or neutralize untrusted web inputs, risking stored XSS injections. 

- [CWE-89](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html): SQL Injection - Applicable if plugins accept raw SQL query inputs without sanitization, enabling SQLi attacks.

- [CWE-284](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html): Improper Access Control - Applicable when plugins are given excessive privileges or have inadequate access control between them, enabling privilege escalation. 

- [CWE-306](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/306.html): Missing Authentication for Critical Function - Applicable if plugins lack authentication checks, permitting unauthorized access. 

- [CWE-346](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/346.html): Origin Validation Error - Applicable if plugin request origins are not validated, enabling CORS exploits.

- [CWE-732](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/732.html): Inadequate Encoding of Output Data - Applicable if plugin output lacks proper encoding, enabling DOM XSS or stored injections.

- [CWE-807](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/807.html): Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision - Applicable if plugins rely on unvalidated inputs in security decisions, enabling exploitation.

- [CWE-862](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/862.html): Missing Authorization - Applicable if authorization checks are missing in plugins, allowing unauthorized access.

## ATT&CK Techniques

- [T1190](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190/) - Exploit Public-Facing Application. Attacks exposed applications which could include public plugin interfaces and endpoints.

## MITRE ATLAS Techniques

- AML.T0047: ML-Enabled Product or Service. Plugins extend capabilities of services, introducing potential input validation, access control and encoding weaknesses.

- AML.T0040: ML Model Inference API Access. Malicious inputs and queries could exploit vulnerabilities in plugins accessible via the API. 

- AML.T0043: Craft Adversarial Data. Carefully crafted data and queries could trigger unintended behaviors in downstream plugins leading to exploitation.

- AML.T0016: Obtain Capabilities. May obtain tools to identify plugin flaws or automate exploiting weaknesses in their implementation.

- AML.T0012: Valid Accounts. Compromised credentials could enable privileged actions through plugins due to inadequate access controls. 

- AML.T0011: User Execution. Users may unknowingly invoke dangerous plugin functionality through malformed inputs. 

- AML.T0010: ML Supply Chain Compromise. Compromised plugins introduced into the supply chain could contain intentional vulnerabilities that are later exploited.

- AML.T0024: Exfiltration via ML Inference API. Plugins could enable data theft via vulnerabilities exposed through the model API.

- AML.T0044: Full ML Model Access. Full whitebox control allows optimal manipulation of plugins to facilitate exploits through malicious inputs.

- AML.T0019: Publish Poisoned Data. Data obtained from compromised sources could trigger unintended behaviors in downstream plugins leading to exploitation.


Here are the expanded mitigation entries relating to insecure plugin design:

## ATT&CK Mitigations

- [M1042](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1042/) - Disable or Remove Feature or Program. Removes problematic features like unsafe plugins. Eliminating vulnerable plugins reduces the attack surface.

- [M1043](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1043/) - Isolate System or Network. Isolates systems containing plugins. Segmentation could prevent exploits initiated through plugins from impacting other systems.

- [M1049](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1049/) - Disable or Remove Feature or Program. Removes features like insecure plugins. Eliminating vulnerable plugins reduces the attack surface.

## MITRE ATLAS Mitigations

- AML.M0015: Adversarial Input Detection. Detect and filter malicious inputs and queries to plugins before reaching vulnerable code. Identifies and blocks potential exploits.

- AML.M0004: Restrict Number of ML Model Queries. Limit total queries and rate to plugins which reduces the attack surface for sending malicious inputs. 

- AML.M0014: Verify ML Artifacts. Detect compromised or tampered plugins through verifying integrity. Identifies problematic plugins.

- AML.M0013: Code Signing. Ensure proper signing of plugins before integration to validate they have not been tampered with.

- AML.M0005: Control Access to ML Models and Data at Rest. Limit plugin access to sensitive data through permissions. Reduces exposure from compromised plugins.

- AML.M0003: Model Hardening. Make models robust to plugin manipulation through malicious inputs. Hardens model against plugins.

- AML.M0016: Vulnerability Scanning. Scan plugins for flaws and weaknesses. Identifies vulnerabilities to address proactively. 

- AML.M0012: Encrypt Sensitive Information. Encrypt sensitive data to prevent exposure through potential vulnerabilities in integrated plugins. 

- AML.M0018: User Training. Educate users on potential plugin risks so they avoid unknowingly invoking dangerous functionality.
