# LLM08: Excessive Agency

### Summary

Excessive LLM permissions or autonomy enables unintended harmful actions based on faulty LLM outputs.

### Description 

Excessive Agency stems from providing an LLM with more permissions than are necessary for its intended functionality. Specifically, granting excessive:

- Functionality: Access to plugins, tools or capabilities beyond necessity. 

- Permissions: Overly broad access to systems, APIs and data.

- Autonomy: Ability to take impactful actions without human oversight.

Not to be confused with:
- LLM02: Insecure Output Handling - Failing to validate LLM-generated outputs before sending them to downstream services can allow insecure code or attack strings to reach vulnerable systems. 

- LLM07: Insecure Plugin Design - Lack of validation by downstream components 

- LLM09: Overreliance - Placing too much trust in the accuracy of LLM outputs 

Excessive Agency outside an LLM's intended scope enables unintended harmful actions based on faulty model outputs. Potential impacts include data loss, fraud, reputational damage, and more.

Prevention requires narrowly limiting LLM capabilities to least functionality, permissions and autonomy needed for core operations.


### Common Examples of Risk

1. Plugins have unnecessary functions beyond what's needed. 

2. Plugins fail to filter inputs properly.

3. Plugins get more access permissions than required.

4. Plugins use high-privilege identities unnecessarily. 

5. Plugins take actions without approval.

### Prevention and Mitigation Strategies

1. Only allow necessary plugin functions.

2. Restrict plugin functions to the minimum needed. 

3. Avoid open-ended plugin functions when possible.

4. Give plugins least privilege access to other systems.

5. Check user authorization for all plugin actions. 

6. Require human approval for impactful actions.

7. Validate all plugin requests against security policies.

### Example Attack Scenarios

1. A mail plugin can send messages when it should only read mail. The LLM is tricked into sending spam.

2. A plugin has unnecessary database access. The LLM deletes records it shouldn't. 

3. A plugin uses an admin account unnecessarily. The LLM makes changes as admin without approval.

4. A social media plugin can post without approval. The LLM posts inappropriate content.


### MITRE ATLAS™ 

#### Techniques
- [AML.T0006](https://atlas.mitre.org/techniques/AML.T0006/): Active Scanning - The adversary could actively probe the LLM to find prompts that seem to enable elevated permissions

- [AML.T0025](https://atlas.mitre.org/techniques/AML.T0025/): Exfiltration via Cyber Means - Exfiltrating data like logs could help the adversary understand how to manipulate the LLM 

- [AML.T0043](https://atlas.mitre.org/techniques/AML.T0043/): Craft Adversarial Data - Crafting adversarial prompts could then exploit elevated permissions to take unintended actions

#### Mitigations
- [AML.M0004](https://atlas.mitre.org/mitigations/AML.M0004): Restrict Number of ML Model Queries - Limit ability to probe model. 

- [AML.M0015](https://atlas.mitre.org/mitigations/AML.M0015): Adversarial Input Detection - Catch abnormal permission elevation attempts.

#### Possible Additions

**Possible Additional Mitigations** 

Audit LLM Activities - Continuously monitor and audit LLM behaviors, permissions, and access to detect anomalies or actions outside expected boundaries that could signal unintended consequences.

Limit LLM Capabilities - Carefully restrict the specific functions and capabilities the LLM can perform to only those necessary for its core intended purpose, reducing potential for unintended actions.


### STRIDE Analysis (generated by claude.ai)

**Spoofing**

- Adversaries can spoof user identities through valid credentials to bypass authorization controls when manipulating model behaviors.

- Excessive privileges granted to plugins and components can be abused to spoof trusted identities.

**Tampering**

- Unchecked model behaviors mean malicious inputs can precisely control and tamper with model actions and outputs.

- Excessive permissions enable tampering with downstream data and systems.

**Repudiation** 

- Lack of permissions auditing around manipulated behaviors can complicate attack attribution.

- Tampering with logs can undermine forensic analysis of exploited autonomous behaviors.


**Information Disclosure**

- Uncontrolled model outputs increase the risk of exposing sensitive information.

- Access to backend systems means private data can be extracted through manipulated behaviors.


**Denial of Service**

- Unchecked recursive model invocations could trigger resource exhaustion.

- Malicious adversarial samples could crash models or render them unusable.


**Elevation of Privilege**

- Excessive permissions granted to plugins can enable privilege escalation on backend systems.

- Valid accounts and poor access controls enable bypassing privilege restrictions.

# IGNORE FOR NOW - NEED RE-REVIEW



### Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)

- [CWE-272](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/272.html): Least Privilege Violation

  Description: The software performs an operation at a privilege level higher than the minimum level required, which can cause unintended information disclosures or access control bypasses.

  Justification: Core to the issue of excessive agency is the violation of the principle of least privilege. By providing more permissions than necessary, LLMs are given a wider range of potential actions, thereby increasing the risk of unauthorized or unintended actions.

- [CWE-269](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/269.html): Improper Privilege Management

  Description: The software does not properly manage privileges to restrict access to only authorized users or processes. This may allow an actor to access or perform unauthorized functions.

  Justification: In an environment where LLMs have excessive agency, improper privilege management can exacerbate risks significantly, enabling unauthorized actions.

- [CWE-284](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html): Improper Access Control

  Description: The software does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.

  Justification: Applicable as poor access controls in components interacting with the LLM pose risks of unauthorized actions.

- [CWE-285](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/285.html): Improper Authorization

  Description: The software does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

  Justification: Directly relevant as components interacting with the LLM may lack proper authorization checks.


### MITRE ATT&CK® Techniques

- [T1078](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/): Valid Accounts

  Description: Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of existing accounts as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion.

  Justification: In environments where LLMs have excessive permissions, the risk of adversaries using valid accounts to abuse these permissions increases.

- [T1548](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/): Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism

  Description: Exploiting weak access controls to leverage excessive privileges.

  Justification: Relevant technique to exploit excessive plugin privileges granted to the LLM.

### MITRE ATT&CK® Mitigations

- [M1027](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1027/): Password Policies  

  Description: Set and enforce secure password policies for accounts.

  Justification: Strong authentication makes unauthorized access more difficult.

- [M1042](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1042/): Disable or Remove Feature or Program

  Description: Remove or deny access to unnecessary and potentially vulnerable software to prevent abuse by adversaries.

  Justification: Reducing available services limits potential vectors to manipulate behaviors.  

- [M1030](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1030/): Network Segmentation

  Description: Architect sections of the network to isolate critical systems, functions, or resources. Use physical and logical segmentation to prevent access to potentially sensitive systems and information.

  Justification: Network segmentation can isolate critical systems from manipulation.

- [M1032](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1032/): Multi-factor Authentication

  Description: Use two or more pieces of evidence to authenticate to a system; such as username and password in addition to a token from a physical smart card or token generator.

  Justification: Raises the bar for gaining access needed to manipulate behaviors.
