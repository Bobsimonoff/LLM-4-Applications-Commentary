# LLM03: Training Data Poisoning

### Summary

Tampered training data can impair LLM models leading to responses that may compromise security, accuracy, or ethical behavior.

### Description

Training Data Poisoning involves manipulating the data used to train LLMs to impair model capabilities and outputs. 

Poisoned training data like falsified, biased, or malicious content can lead to compromised security, accuracy, or ethical model behavior. Attackers may target pre-training data or data used for fine-tuning and embeddings. Impacts include unreliable outputs, biases, information leakage, reputation damage, and flawed decisions.

Prevention involves verifying supply chain integrity, validating legitimacy of data sources, isolating training environments, sanitizing inputs, and incorporating adversarial robustness techniques. Monitoring model behavior and using human review loops can help detect poisoning attacks.


### Common Examples of Risk

1. Malicious actor poisons model training data with falsified information that impacts model outputs.

2. Attacker directly injects harmful content into model training which is reflected in outputs. 

3. User unintentionally leaks sensitive data that appears in model outputs.

4. Model trains on unverified data leading to inaccurate outputs.

5. Model ingests unsafe data due to lack of access controls, generating harmful outputs.

### Prevention and Mitigation Strategies

1. Verify training data supply chain, sources, and contents.

2. Confirm legitimacy of all data used in training stages.

3. Craft separate models for different use cases with tailored training data.

4. Sandbox models to restrict ingestion of unintended data sources. 

5. Filter and sanitize training data inputs.

6. Use robustness techniques like federated learning to minimize outlier impact.

7. Test models and monitor outputs to detect poisoning signs.

### Example Attack Scenarios

1. Attacker poisons training data to bias model outputs and mislead users. 

2. Malicious user injects toxic data into training, adapting model to generate biased output.

3. Attacker creates fake documents that manipulate model training, impacting outputs.

4. Attacker exploits prompt injection to insert malicious data into model training.

### Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) 

- [CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html): Improper Input Validation

  Description: Missing or inadequate input validation leads to unchecked tainted input used directly or indirectly resulting in dangerous downstream behaviors.

  Justification: Lack of validation enables poisoning of training data by allowing malicious data to be ingested without inspection.

- [CWE-306](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/306.html): Missing Authentication for Critical Function

  Description: The software does not perform or incorrectly performs an authentication check when an actor attempts to access a critical function or resource.

  Justification: Lack of authentication of data sources can allow poisoning by permitting unauthorized access to manipulate training data.

- [CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html): Deserialization of Untrusted Data

  Description: The application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid.

  Justification: Deserializing untrusted training data poses risks of executing adversary code in poisoned serialized models or datasets.

- [CWE-693](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/693.html): Protection Mechanism Failure

  Description: A protection mechanism unexpectedly fails to be enforced or performs an unexpected negative action. This may lead to unintended adverse consequences that were supposed to be prevented by the mechanism.

  Justification: Failure of protections can enable poisoning by allowing defenses to be circumvented.

- [CWE-829](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/829.html): Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere

  Description: The software imports, requires, or includes executable functionality (such as a library) from a source that is outside of the intended control sphere.

  Justification: Poisoned data introduces unintended functionality by including malicious content.

- [CWE-937](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/937.html): OWASP Top Ten 2013 Category A9 - Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities

  Description: The software is out-of-date, lacking patches, or uses components with publicly known vulnerabilities.

  Justification: Vulnerable components could enable poisoning by providing a vector for malicious data to enter workflow.


### MITRE ATT&CK Techniques

- [T1565](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/): Data Manipulation

  Description: Adversaries may manipulate and forge file contents and metadata to confuse and mislead forensic investigators or file analysis tools. File attributes like timestamps can be modified to mimic legitimate files. Adversaries may tamper with data at rest or in transit to manipulate external outcomes.

  Justification: Could directly poison training data by manipulating datasets before they are consumed.


### MITRE ATLAS Techniques

- AML.T0019: Publish Poisoned Datasets

  Description: Adversaries may publish poisoned datasets designed to manipulate and impair models that consume the data. Publishing provides a vector to introduce malicious data into victim training pipelines.

  Justification: Publishing poisoned data enables poisoning by making malicious datasets available to unsuspecting consumers.

- AML.T0020: Poison Training Data

  Description: Adversaries may directly poison training data to embed flaws activated later. Poisoned data introduced via supply chain attacks or after gaining access persistently compromises integrity of models trained on the data.

  Justification: Poisoning training data is a direct way to manipulate model capabilities by embedding vulnerabilities.

- AML.T0035: ML Artifact Collection

  Description: Adversaries may collect artifacts like training data for exfiltration or use in attack staging. Access to training data provides the ability to directly manipulate and poison it.

  Justification: Access to training data enables poisoning by permitting direct data manipulation.

- AML.T0036: Data from Information Repositories

  Description: By mining repositories, adversaries can discover details of training data sources, enabling them to target sources directly for poisoning attacks.

  Justification: Discovering data repository details reveals training data sources to target.
  
- AML.T0043: Craft Adversarial Data

  Description: Adversaries may carefully craft malicious training data designed to manipulate model capabilities. The tailored data embeds specific flaws during training.

  Justification: Crafting poisoned data precisely manipulates models by embedding flaws.


### MITRE ATT&CK Mitigations

- [M1041](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1041/): Restrict Web-Based Content

  Description: Allowlisting, blocking, or sandboxing web content will reduce the attack surface against web-based attacks, resulting in safer web browsing and reduced phishing effectiveness.

  Justification: Could block web access to poisoned data by restricting web content loading.

- [M1043](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1043/): Isolate System or Network

  Description: Isolate systems from the Internet or untrusted networks, and isolate sensitive systems from vulnerable systems to reduce a threat's ability to access and compromise systems. Network segregation also adds a layer of defense, since an exploitation would have to traverse the boundary to reach other systems.

  Justification: Could prevent poisoned data from spreading by isolating compromised systems.

- [M1050](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1050/): Network Segmentation

  Description: Segment networks to enforce a degree of separation between systems that reduces the ability for lateral movement and limits traffic to other enclaves and zones. Network segmentation can be achieved through the use of emerging network virtualization techniques, VLANs, and physically separated network segments joined by guarded network gateways.

  Justification: Could prevent poisoned data accessing production systems by enforcing network boundaries.

- [M1015](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1015/): Secure Authentication

  Description: Adversaries commonly steal credentials or reuse existing compromised credentials as a means of gaining Initial Access; limiting accessibility and applying multi-factor authentication makes credential theft more difficult. Enable MFA/2FA and use centralized management to enforce secure authentication across all systems, services, and infrastructure.

  Justification: Secure authentication prevents unauthorized data poisoning.
