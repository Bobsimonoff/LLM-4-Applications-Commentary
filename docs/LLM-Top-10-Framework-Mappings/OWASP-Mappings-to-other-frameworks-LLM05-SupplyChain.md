# LLM05: Supply Chain Vulnerabilities

## Summary 
Depending upon compromised components, services or datasets undermine system integrity, causing data breaches and system failures.


## Description

Supply chain vulnerabilities arise when compromised third-party components undermine system integrity. Attackers can exploit these to cause data breaches, biased outputs, and system failures.

Vulnerable components like unpatched libraries, contaminated datasets, and compromised model artifacts enable attackers to infiltrate systems. They may manipulate training data to insert biases, backdoors, or errors that degrade model integrity. Successful attacks can lead to IP theft, privacy violations, security breaches, and non-compliance with regulations.

Prevention involves extensive supplier vetting, integrity checks, and monitoring. Only use trusted suppliers and ensure alignment of security policies. Scrutinize third-party plugins before integration. Maintain updated inventories of components, and implement code signing for models. Audit supplier security regularly.


## Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)

[CWE-494](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/494.html): Download of Code Without Integrity Check - Applicable as unauthorized third-party code may be downloaded without integrity checks.

[CWE-733](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/733.html): Compiler Optimization Removal or Modification of Security-critical Code - Applicable as optimizations could remove security controls in third-party code. 

[CWE-829](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/829.html): Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere - Applicable as third-party code introduces risks of untrusted functionality.

[CWE-915](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/915.html): Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes - Applicable as lack of control over dynamic attributes in third-party code poses risks.

[CWE-918](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/918.html): Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) - Applicable as third-party requests may not be properly validated, enabling SSRF.

[CWE-937](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/937.html): OWASP Top Ten 2013 Category A5 - Security Misconfiguration - Applicable as misconfigured third-party components pose risks per OWASP guidelines. 

[CWE-916](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/916.html): Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort - Applicable if third-party code uses weak hashing.

## ATT&CK Techniques

- [T1195](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1195/) - Supply Chain Compromise. Manipulates products or services. Directly compromises supply chain.

## ATT&CK Mitigations

- [M1048](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1048/) - Perform Software and File Integrity Checking. Checks integrity of assets. Could detect tampered supply chain components.

- [M1053](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1053/) - Disable or Restrict Resource Consumption Settings. Limits resource use. Could prevent compromised components from overloading systems. 


## MITRE ATLAS Techniques
