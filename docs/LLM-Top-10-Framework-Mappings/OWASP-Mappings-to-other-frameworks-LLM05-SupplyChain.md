# LLM05: Supply Chain Vulnerabilities

### Summary 
Depending upon compromised components, services or datasets undermine system integrity, causing data breaches and system failures.


### Description

Supply chain vulnerabilities arise when compromised third-party components undermine system integrity. Attackers can exploit these to cause data breaches, biased outputs, and system failures.

Vulnerable components like unpatched libraries, contaminated datasets, and compromised model artifacts enable attackers to infiltrate systems. They may manipulate training data to insert biases, backdoors, or errors that degrade model integrity. Successful attacks can lead to IP theft, privacy violations, security breaches, and non-compliance with regulations.

Prevention involves extensive supplier vetting, integrity checks, and monitoring. Only use trusted suppliers and ensure alignment of security policies. Scrutinize third-party plugins before integration. Maintain updated inventories of components, and implement code signing for models. Audit supplier security regularly.

### Common Examples of Risk

1. Outdated or insecure third-party libraries and components.

2. Use of vulnerable pre-trained models.

3. Training with poisoned crowd-sourced data. 

4. Using unmaintained deprecated models.

5. Unclear supplier terms enabling data misuse.

### Prevention and Mitigation Strategies

1. Vet suppliers and ensure security policies align.

2. Scrutinize and test third-party plugins before use.

3. Apply mitigations from OWASP Top Ten vulnerable components guidance. 

4. Maintain updated component inventories with SBOMs.

5. Use model signing and reputable model repositories. 

6. Scan models and data for poisoning.

7. Monitor for unauthorized components and vulnerabilities.

8. Patch vulnerable components.

9. Regularly audit supplier security and access.

### Example Attack Scenarios 

1. Vulnerable library exploits system used in model development.

2. Attacker provides plugin generating scam links.

3. Compromised PyPi package exfiltrates data from model environment.

4. Attacker poisons economic analysis model on public hub to generate misinformation.

5. Attacker poisons public datasets to introduce market bias when models fine-tune.

6. Compromised supplier employee steals confidential data.

7. Supplier changes terms enabling sensitive data exposure.


### Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)

- [CWE-494](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/494.html): Download of Code Without Integrity Check

  Description: Software is downloaded from an untrusted source without verifying its integrity, authenticity, or origin before execution.

  Justification: Could allow inclusion of compromised code through untrusted third-party dependencies.

- [CWE-733](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/733.html): Compiler Optimization Removal or Modification of Security-critical Code

  Description: The unnecessary removal or modification of security-critical code during compile optimization could make the software vulnerable or exploitable when executed.

  Justification: Security controls in third-party code could be removed during compilation, increasing vulnerabilities.

- [CWE-829](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/829.html): Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere

  Description: The software imports, requires, or includes executable functionality (such as a library) from a source that is outside of the intended control sphere.

  Justification: Integration of third-party code introduces risks of untrusted functionality if the supplier is compromised.

- [CWE-915](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/915.html): Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes

  Description: Modifications of object attributes without appropriate constraints can often lead to exploitable vulnerabilities.

  Justification: Lack of control over third-party code attributes poses risks if the supplier is compromised.

- [CWE-918](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/918.html): Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

  Description: An SSRF attack occurs when a web server is tricked into making arbitrary requests on behalf of the attacker and can be used to interact with internal systems.

  Justification: Third-party requests may not be validated after integration, enabling SSRF through compromised suppliers.

- [CWE-937](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/937.html): OWASP Top Ten 2013 Category A9 - Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities

  Description: The software is out-of-date, lacking patches, or makes use of third-party components with publicly known vulnerabilities.

  Justification: Misconfigured third-party components integrated from a compromised supplier pose risks per OWASP.

- [CWE-916](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/916.html): Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort

  Description: The software stores or transmits passwords using hashes that do not provide sufficient computational effort to prevent password cracking.

  Justification: Weak hashing in third-party code could enable password cracking if the supplier is compromised.


## ATT&CK® Technique

- [T1195](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1195/) - Supply Chain Compromise

  Description: Manipulates products or services from third-party suppliers.

  Justification: Directly relevant to compromising the supply chain.



### MITRE ATLAS™ Techniques

- AML.T0016: Obtain Capabilities

  Description: Adversaries may search for and obtain software capabilities like adversarial ML tools to exploit vulnerable supply chain components. Obtaining capabilities aids adversaries in developing attacks targeting weaknesses in integrated third-party code, models, and data.

  Justification: Obtaining attack tools can enable adversaries to exploit vulnerable supply chain components.

- AML.T0024: Exfiltration via ML Inference API

  Description: Adversaries may extract data, models, and other artifacts containing proprietary information or intellectual property via inference APIs of compromised third-party components. This technique exploits vulnerable access controls in integrated suppliers.

  Justification: Inference API access to compromised third-party components enables data and IP exfiltration.
  
- AML.T0031: Erode ML Model Integrity

  Description: Adversaries can degrade model performance over time by exploiting vulnerabilities in integrated components to craft malicious inputs. Continually supplying adversarial data via compromised suppliers erodes integrity and causes system failures.

  Justification: Introducing adversarial data through compromised third parties erodes model integrity.


### MITRE ATT&CK® Mitigations

- [M1048](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1048/) - Perform Software and File Integrity Checking

  Description: Check the integrity of software and files to detect tampering.

  Justification: Could detect compromised or tampered third-party components.


### MITRE ATLAS™ Mitigations

- AML.M0002: Passive ML Output Obfuscation
  Description: Decreasing the fidelity of model outputs provided to the end user can reduce an adversaries ability to extract information about the model and optimize attacks for the model.

- AML.M0003: Model Hardening  
  Description: Use techniques to make machine learning models robust to adversarial inputs such as adversarial training or network distillation.

- AML.M0012: Encrypt Sensitive Information
  Description: Encrypt sensitive data such as ML models to protect against adversaries attempting to access sensitive data.

- AML.M0015: Adversarial Input Detection
  Description: Detect and block adversarial inputs or atypical queries that deviate from known benign behavior, exhibit behavior patterns observed in previous attacks or that come from potentially malicious IPs. Incorporate adversarial detection algorithms into the ML system prior to the ML model.
