# LLM05: Supply Chain Vulnerabilities

## Summary 
Depending upon compromised components, services or datasets undermine system integrity, causing data breaches and system failures.


## Description

Supply chain vulnerabilities arise when compromised third-party components undermine system integrity. Attackers can exploit these to cause data breaches, biased outputs, and system failures.

Vulnerable components like unpatched libraries, contaminated datasets, and compromised model artifacts enable attackers to infiltrate systems. They may manipulate training data to insert biases, backdoors, or errors that degrade model integrity. Successful attacks can lead to IP theft, privacy violations, security breaches, and non-compliance with regulations.

Prevention involves extensive supplier vetting, integrity checks, and monitoring. Only use trusted suppliers and ensure alignment of security policies. Scrutinize third-party plugins before integration. Maintain updated inventories of components, and implement code signing for models. Audit supplier security regularly.


## CWE

[CWE-937](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/937.html): OWASP Top Ten 2013 Category A5 - Security Misconfiguration - Applicable as misconfigured third-party components pose risks per OWASP guidelines. 

[CWE-916](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/916.html): Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort - Applicable if third-party code uses weak hashing.

## NIST CSF

**Identify - Asset Management:**
- ID.AM-1: Physical devices and systems within the organization are inventoried. This helps maintain an inventory of pre-trained models and other software assets to identify vulnerable or outdated components.

**Identify - Risk Assessment:**  
- ID.RA-1: Asset vulnerabilities are identified and documented. This enables identifying vulnerabilities in pre-trained models, third-party components, etc.

**Protect - Identity Management and Access Control:**
- PR.AC-1: Identities and credentials are issued, managed, verified, revoked, and audited for authorized devices, users and processes. This enables access control on external systems and suppliers.

**Protect - Information Protection:**  
- PR.IP-1: Baseline configuration of systems are created and maintained. Helps prevent misconfigurations of third-party components.

**Detect - Anomalies and Events:**
- DE.AE-1: A baseline of network operations and expected data flows is established and managed. Anomalies can indicate malicious third-party code execution or data exfiltration.
