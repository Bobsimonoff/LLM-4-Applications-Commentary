# Vulnerabilities and Weaknesses

Map CWE weaknesses to OWASP LLM01 Prompt Injection by identifying how those CWE issues could enable Prompt Injection attacks, based on the OWASP LLM01 description provided. 

For each CWE, provide the following in bullet list format:

- The identifier formatted as [ID](URL to weakness definition) 

- Name of the vulnerability/weakness

- Brief description of the vulnerability/weakness

- Explanation of how the vulnerability/weakness could enable Prompt Injection attacks on a LLM-based application

Use the following structure:

### Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)

- [CWE-ID](URL): Name. Brief description. Explanation of how this could enable Prompt Injection.


# Threats and Attack Vectors

Map MITRE ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques to OWASP LLM01 Prompt Injection by identifying which Tactics and Techniques target Prompt Injection risks, based on the OWASP LLM01 description provided. 

For each Tactic, Technique, and Threat, provide the following in bullet list format:

- The identifier formatted as [ID](URL to the Tactic and Technique definition) 

- Name of the Tactics and Techniques

- Brief description of the Tactics and Techniques

- Explanation of how the Tactics and Techniquescould target Prompt Injection attacks on a LLM-based application

Use the following structure:

## MITRE ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques**

- [ID](URL): Name. Brief description. Explanation of how this could enable Prompt Injection.
