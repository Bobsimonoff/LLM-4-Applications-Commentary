# LLM04: Denial of Service

### Summary 

Overloading LLMs with resource-intensive operations can cause service disruptions, performance degradation, and increased costs.

### Description  

Denial of service attacks on LLMs involve overloading the model with inputs or operations that consume excessive computational resources. Attackers may send unusual inputs, malformed queries, or sequences of requests that strain the LLM beyond its capabilities. Common methods include input flooding, recursive context expansion, and carefully crafted variable-length requests that approach context window limits. This overloads the LLM's processing capacity and memory, causing slowdowns, unavailability of services, increased infrastructure costs, and revenue losses. Prevention involves input sanitization, resource capping, context window limits, rate limiting, resource monitoring, and secure architecture and implementation guidelines.


### Common Examples of Risk

1. Sending queries that recursively generate excessive tasks. 

2. Submitting inputs with unusual formatting that require extensive processing.

3. Flooding systems with continuous input exceeding context limits. 

4. Repeatedly sending long inputs that strain context window capacity. 

5. Crafting inputs that recursively expand context causing repeated processing.

6. Flooding systems with variable length inputs approaching context limits.

### Prevention and Mitigation Strategies

1. Validate and sanitize input data to defined limits.

2. Cap resource usage per request to slow complex inputs. 

3. Enforce API rate limiting to restrict requests.

4. Limit queued actions and total actions after LLM responses.

5. Monitor for spikes in resource utilization indicating attacks.

6. Set strict input size limits based on context window. 

7. Educate developers on potential denial of service risks.

### Example Attack Scenarios

1. Attacker overwhelms systems with repeated expensive requests, degrading performance.

2. Benign web query triggers excessive resource consumption through model interactions.

3. Attacker floods LLM with input exceeding context window, crashing system. 

4. Attacker sends sequential inputs approaching context limit, exhausting resources.

5. Attacker crafted input causes repeated context expansion, straining systems.

6. Attacker floods systems with varied length inputs targeting context limits.



### Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)

- [CWE-16](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/16.html): Configuration

  Description: Failure to control resource consumption enabling exhaustion of resources like CPU, memory, disk space, database connections, etc.

  Justification: Directly targets the risk by facilitating both direct and indirect resource exhaustion through unchecked resource usage, making it a cornerstone vulnerability in Denial of Service attacks on LLMs.

- [CWE-770](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/770.html): Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling

  Description: Failure to throttle or limit allocation of resources enabling unchecked consumption.

  Justification: Lack of throttling allows unchecked resource usage enabling exhaustion.

- [CWE-799](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/799.html): Improper Control of Interaction Frequency

  Description: Failure to limit the frequency of interactions enabling repeated operations that strain resources.

  Justification: Lack of frequency control allows flooding requests overwhelming resources.

- [CWE-918](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/918.html): Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

  Description: Failure to block server-side execution of maliciously crafted external URIs, leading to data exposure or resource exhaustion.

  Justification: In a LLM context, SSRF can be exploited to create tasks that indirectly exhaust resources by causing the LLM to make additional unintended external requests, further amplifying the DoS effect.

- [CWE-829](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/829.html): Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere

  Description: Use of untrusted code or inputs leading to unintended functionality.

  Justification: Extensions/plugins could trigger resource issues by including uncontrolled functionality.

  Justification: Adaptive rate limiting can effectively counter DoS attacks that may not be easily caught by static rate limits.



### STRIDE Analysis (generated by clause.ai)

Denial of service attacks can impact multiple components of the STRIDE threat model:

**Spoofing**

- Attackers can spoof the origin of requests to disguise their source and make attribution more difficult.

**Tampering**

- Malicious requests can tamper with model behaviors by overloading systems and disrupting availability.

**Repudiation** 

- Lack of logging around malicious requests complicates attack attribution and allows repudiation.
- DoS attacks could also tamper with or disable logging to undermine attribution.

**Information Disclosure**

- Flooding attacks do not directly cause information disclosure but service disruption enables easier access to compromised systems.

**Denial of Service**

- Specially crafted inputs trigger resource exhaustion, system crashes, and service disruption.
- Flooding systems with requests disrupts availability and prevents legitimate use.

**Elevation of Privilege**

- While DoS does not directly enable privilege escalation, service disruption provides opportunities for unauthorized access.
- Compromised credentials allow attackers to more easily trigger DoS conditions.
