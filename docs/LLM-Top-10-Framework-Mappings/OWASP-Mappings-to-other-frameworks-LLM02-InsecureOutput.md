# LM02: Insecure Output Handling

## Summary

Neglecting to validate LLM outputs may lead to downstream security exploits, including code execution that compromises systems and exposes data.

## Description

Insecure Output Handling arises when downstream components blindly accept LLM outputs without scrutiny, enabling attackers to indirectly access functionality or trigger exploits.

Neglecting to validate or sanitize LLM-generated outputs before passing them to backend systems, browsers, or other downstream components can enable code execution, system compromise, and data exposure. Attackers can manipulate LLM output via crafted prompts, similar to providing indirect user access. 

Successful attacks can lead to privilege escalation, command injection, XSS, SSRF, and remote code execution. High LLM privileges and external prompt injection increase impacts.

Prevention involves treating the LLM as any other user, applying input validation and sanitization per OWASP guidelines, and encoding outputs to mitigate code execution. LLM access should be limited using least privilege principles.

## Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)

[CWE-78](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html): OS Command Injection - Applicable as lack of output validation could allow command injection when passed to system functions.

[CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html): Cross-site Scripting - Applicable as inadequate output encoding risks XSS vulnerabilities in web contexts. 

[CWE-89](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html): SQL Injection - Applicable as passing unvalidated LLM outputs to SQL can lead to injection.

[CWE-94](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html): Code Injection - Applicable as directly executing unvalidated output could allow arbitrary code execution.

[CWE-200](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html): Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor - Added as insecure handling can expose sensitive data.

[CWE-284](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html): Improper Access Control - Added as lack of access control on outputs can enable exploits. 

[CWE-829](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/829.html): Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere - Applicable as untrusted outputs may trigger unintended functionality.

[CWE-937](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/937.html): OWASP Top Ten 2013 Category A9 - Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities - Added as vulnerable components could mishandle outputs.
