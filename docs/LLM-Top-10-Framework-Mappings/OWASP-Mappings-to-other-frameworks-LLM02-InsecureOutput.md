# LM02: Insecure Output Handling

### Summary

Neglecting to validate Large Language Model outputs may lead to downstream security exploits, including code execution that compromises systems and exposes data.

### Description

Insecure Output Handling arises when downstream components blindly accept LLM outputs without scrutiny, enabling attackers to indirectly access functionality or trigger exploits.

Neglecting to validate or sanitize LLM-generated outputs before passing them to backend systems, browsers, or other downstream components can enable code execution, system compromise, and data exposure. Attackers can manipulate LLM output via crafted prompts, similar to providing indirect user access. 

Successful attacks can lead to privilege escalation, command injection, XSS, SSRF, and remote code execution. High LLM privileges and external prompt injection increase impacts.

Prevention involves treating the LLM as any other user, applying input validation and sanitization per OWASP guidelines, and encoding outputs to mitigate code execution. LLM access should be limited using least privilege principles.


### Common Examples of Risk 

1. Executing unchecked LLM output in system shells enabling command injection.

2. Returning unvalidated JavaScript/Markdown from LLM to browsers causing XSS.

### Prevention and Mitigation Strategies

1. Validate LLM outputs to backends per OWASP input validation guidelines.

2. Encode LLM outputs to users per OWASP output encoding guidance.

### Example Attack Scenarios

1. Unvalidated chatbot response executed as system commands, allowing RCE.

2. Website summarizer exfiltrates data through LLM output encoding. 

3. LLM generates malicious SQL query that wipes database after execution.

4. Attacker uses prompt injection for LLM to return unsanitized XSS payload.



### Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)

- [CWE-78](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html): OS Command Injection

  Description: The software constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.

  Justification: Failure to validate outputs could allow command injection when passed to system functions.

- [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html): Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')

  Description: The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

  Justification: Inadequate output encoding risks XSS vulnerabilities in web contexts.

- [CWE-89](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html): Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')

  Description: The software constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.

  Justification: Passing outputs to SQL could lead to injection.

- [CWE-94](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html): Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')

  Description: The software constructs all or part of a code segment using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the syntax or behavior of the intended code segment.

  Justification: Direct execution of outputs could allow arbitrary code execution.
