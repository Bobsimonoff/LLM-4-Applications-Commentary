# LLM10: Model Theft

### Summary
Unauthorized access to proprietary large language models risks theft, competitive advantage, and dissemination of sensitive information.

### Description

Unauthorized access and theft of proprietary large language models can undermine competitive advantage and lead to data breaches. 

Attackers can exploit weak access controls, insufficient monitoring, vulnerable components, and insider threats to infiltrate systems and steal valuable LLMs. Successful attacks enable adversaries to acquire sensitive data, launch advanced prompt engineering attacks, and financially damage organizations.

Prevention requires strong access controls, network security, authentication, and monitoring. LLMs should have restricted network access and regular auditing of related logs and activities. Robust MLOps governance, input filtering, and output encoding can help prevent extraction attacks. Physical security and watermarking also help mitigate risks. Proactively securing LLMs against theft is crucial for maintaining confidentiality of intellectual property.


### Common Examples of Risk

1. Attacker exploits infrastructure vulnerabilities, gaining unauthorized access to LLM repositories due to misconfigurations.
2. Centralized ML Model Inventory enforces access controls, authentication, and monitoring for production ML models.
3. Insider threats involve employees leaking LLM-related artifacts.
4. Attacker queries the model API to create a shadow model through crafted inputs.
5. Malicious actors bypass input filtering, performing side-channel attacks to harvest model data.
6. Attackers fine-tune models by querying LLMs with numerous prompts.
7. **_Functional model replication_** creates functional equivalents using LLMs through prompts.

Stolen models can facilitate adversarial attacks, including unauthorized data access.

### Prevention and Mitigation Strategies

1. Implement strong access controls and authentication to restrict unauthorized LLM access.
2. Limit LLM's network access and monitor access logs.
3. Regularly audit access logs.
4. Automate MLOps deployment with governance.
5. Mitigate prompt injection risks.
6. Apply rate limiting or filters for data exfiltration prevention.
7. Deploy adversarial robustness training and enhance physical security.
8. Use watermarking in LLMs.

### Example Attack Scenarios

1. Attacker exploits infrastructure vulnerabilities to steal LLMs, using them to compete or extract sensitive data.
2. Disgruntled employees leak LLMs, increasing the risk of attacks.
3. Attacker crafts precise inputs to create shadow models.
4. Supply chain security failure leads to proprietary model leaks.
5. Malicious actors bypass input filtering, performing side-channel attacks to retrieve model data.
